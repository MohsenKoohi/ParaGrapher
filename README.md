# [ParaGrapher: Graph Loading API and Library](https://blogs.qub.ac.uk/DIPSA/ParaGrapher/)

**https://blogs.qub.ac.uk/DIPSA/ParaGrapher**

This repository contains the source code of ParaGrapher, an API and library for loading graphs.
For futher information about the library please refer to https://blogs.qub.ac.uk/DIPSA/ParaGrapher/ and publications.

### ParaGrapher API Documentation
Please visit the [Wiki](../../wiki/API-Documentation) or download the PDF file using [this link](../../raw/main/doc/api.pdf).

### Implemented Graph Types in ParaGrapher Library
 - **PARAGRAPHER_CSX_WG_400_AP** : WebGraphs with 4 Bytes ID per vertex without weights on edges or vertices
 - **PARAGRAPHER_CSX_WG_800_AP** : Big WebGraphs with 8 Bytes ID per vertex without weights on edges or vertices
 - **PARAGRAPHER_CSX_WG_404_AP** : WebGraphs with 4 Bytes ID per vertex and 4 Bytes integer weight per edge and without weights on vertices

### Requirements

- `gcc` with a version greater than 9
- `JDK` with a version greater than 15
- `bc`, `wget`, and `unzip`
- `libfuse3` and `libnuma` for using `pg_fuse` (optional)

### Download Sample Datasets
- Run `make download_WG400`, `make download_WG404`, or `make download_WG800`  
to download and store sample datasets into the `test/datasets` folder.

### Compiling and Executing Code
- By commenting `-DNDEBUG` in Line 19 of the `Makefile`, ParaGrapher will output its logs.

- With `make all` the C and Java source codes are compiled and the required WebGraph libraries are downloaded.
  
- All compiled and downloaded files are stored in the `lib64` folder and future calls to the library requires setting
the `PARAGRAPHER_LIB_FOLDER` environemnt variable to the `lib64` folder.

- The `test` folder contains sample codes for different types of graphs.
You may pass argument `dataset` to specify the location of the test, e.g., 
`make test1_deg_dist_WG400 dataset=path/to/dataset`.

- In the first access to the graphs in WebGraph format a delay may be experienced for creating two files by the library:
  1. A WebGraph `.offset` file is required which is created through a call to the WebGraph framework.
  2. An `_offsets.bin` file is created that contains the offsets array of the CSX format but in binary and 
littel-endian format with 8-Bytes values for each of |V|+1 elements.
In case of [MS-BioGraphs](https://blogs.qub.ac.uk/DIPSA/MS-BioGraphs/), the file with name `MS??_offsets.bin` can
be downloaded and renamed as `MS??-underlying_offsets.bin` to prevent creating.

- ParaGrapher creates shared memory objects (in `/dev/shm`) with names starting by `paragrapher_` for communication
between C and Java sides. The files are deleted at the end of a successful exuection.
Otherwise, they should be manually deleted using `make clean-shm-files`.

- After calling ParaGrapher, the cached contents of the storage should be dropped using 
[`echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches`](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/vm.txt)
or by calling the [`flushcache`](test/flushcache.c) program that 
has the same functionality but with a longer execution time.

### ParaGrapher FUSE File System (PG-FUSE)

To accelerate the loading WebGraphs, ParaGrapher introduces `pg_fuse`, a custom file system built on top of the
FUSE framework.

To enable `pg_fuse`, simply pass `USE_PG_FUSE` as an argument in the `args` parameter of
the `paragrapher_open_graph()` function.

For more detailed information, refer to [PG-FUSE documentation](doc/pg_fuse.md).

### Bandwidth Measurement

- The file [test/read_bandwidth.c](test/read_bandwidth.c) contains a 
benchmark implemented in C to measure the read bandwidth of storage for (i) different thread numbers, (ii) different block sizes, and
(iii) different read methods (read(), pread(), mmap()).

- The file [test/ReadBandwidth.java](test/ReadBandwidth.java) contains a 
benchmark implemented in Java to measure the read bandwidth of storage for (i) different thread numbers, (ii) different block sizes, and
(iii) different read methods (read(), mmap()). The script [test/java-read-bandwidth.sh](test/java-read-bandwidth.sh) 
may  be used for changing parameters.

- The [Storage Bandwidth Evaluation](doc/storage-eval.md) shows the execution results of the above programs for three storage types, SSD, HDD, and LustreFS.
